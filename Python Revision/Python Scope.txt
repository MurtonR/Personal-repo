A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called the 'scope'.


A variable created inside a function belongs to the 'local scope' of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

Example:
def myfruits():
    myTuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    for x in myTuple:
         print(x)
   
myfruits()


print(myTuple) #Prints, NameError: name 'myTuple' is not defined. Did you mean:        	        'tuple'?



If you need to create a global variable but are stuck in local space, you can use the 'global' keyword. The 'global' keyword makes the variable global.
