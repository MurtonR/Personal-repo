A while loop is used to execute statements for as long as the conditions are true.

Example:

i = 1
while i < 4:
   print(i)
   i += 1



 

By using the break statement a loop can be ended even if the condition is still true.

Example:

i = 1
while i < 7:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        print(i) #Prints, 1 2 3 4 5 
        break   





The continue statement can be used in order to skip the current iteration and begin the next iteration.

Example:

i = 0
while i < 7:
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i) #Prints, 1 2 3 4 6 7 , doesn't print 5 as when i == 5 it is skipped using the continue statement





Using the else statement we can run a block of code once the condition is no longer true.

Example:

i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    print(i)
else:
    print("i is larger than 5") #Prints, 1 2 3 4 5  i is larger than 5
