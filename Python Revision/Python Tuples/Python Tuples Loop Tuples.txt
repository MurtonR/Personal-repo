It is the exact same as lists to loop through tuples.

Example:

myTuples = ("Joe", "Biden", "Nice")

for x in myTuples:
    print(x) 



myTuples = ("Joe", "Biden", "Nice")

for i in range(len(myTuples)):
    print(i)



myTuples = ("Joe", "Biden", "Nice")
i = 0

while i < len(myTuples):
    print(myTuples[i])
    i = i + 1
