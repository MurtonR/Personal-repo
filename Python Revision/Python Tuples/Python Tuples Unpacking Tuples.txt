When a tuple is created and the values are assigned this is called packing.

Example:

myTuple = ("Joe", "Biden")

print(myTuple) 




In python it is possible to extract the values back out into variables, this is called unpacking, however the number of variables must match the number of items, or an * must be used to collect the remainin values into a list.

Example:

myTuple = ("Hello", "Joe", "Biden")

greeting, firstName, lastName = myTuple

print(greeting)
print(firstName)
print(lastName)





This is very useful, however the number of variables must match the number of items, or an * must be used to collect the remainin values into a list. If the * is not on the last variable it will collect all the items in a list until the number of items left is equal to number of variables without assigned values.

Example:

myTuple = ("apple", "banana", "orange", "melon")

green, yellow, *orange = myTuple

print(green) #Prints, apple
print(yellow) #Prints, banana
print(orange) #Prints, ['orange', 'melon'] , the values after the asterisks are turned into a list



myTuple = ("apple", "banana", "orange", "melon")

green, *mixed, orange = myTuple

print(green) #Prints, apple
print(mixed) #Prints, ['banana', 'orange']
print(orange) #Prints, melon
