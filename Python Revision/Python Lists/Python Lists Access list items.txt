List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
print(myList[1])




It is possible to use negative indexing to start from the end, with [-1] being the last item in a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
print(myList[-1])




You can also you indexing to access a range of numbers, [2:4] would access 2,3 but not 4. It is possible to use negative indexingfor ranges aswell.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
print(myList[0:2]) #This prints the values of items [0] and [1], ['Joe!', 'Biden']




Additionally either the start or end range numbers can be left out to either start from the first item or have the range end at the last item.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
print(myList[:1]) #Prints, ['Joe!']
print(myList[1:]) #Prints, ['Biden', 'Nice!']




The in keyword can be used to check if an item is present in a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
if "Joe!" in myList:
    print("Wow Joe! is in myList!") #As Joe! is in myList it counts the statement as being true
