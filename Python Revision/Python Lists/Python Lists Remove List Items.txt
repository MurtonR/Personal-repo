The remove() method can be used to remove a specific item from a list

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList.remove("Joe!")
print(myList)




The pop() method will remove a specific index from a list , there is no need to use square brackets when referring to the specific index number, if no index number is referrenced then the last item is deleted.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList.pop(2)
print(myList) #Prints, ['Joe!', 'Biden']

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList.pop()
print(myList) #Prints, ['Joe!', 'Biden']





The del keyword can be used similarly to the pop() method to remove a specific index, however it can also be used to delete the list entirely.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
del myList[0]
print(myList) #Prints, ['Biden', 'Nice!']



myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
del myList
print(myList) #Prints nothing as the list has been deleted completely





The clear() method empties the list and removes all items but the list still remains but empty, unlike the del keyword that completely deletes the contents and the list together.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList.clear()
print(myList) #Prints, []
