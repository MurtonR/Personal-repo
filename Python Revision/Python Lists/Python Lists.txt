Lists are used to store multiple objects in a single variable, lists are one of 4 built-in data types for storing collections of data.

Lists are created by using square brackets.

Example:

myList = ["Joe", "Biden"]
print(myList)




List items are changeable, ordered and allow duplicate values, they are also indexed so the first item has an index of [0] and so on.

A list being ordered means that all the items in a list have a defined order, which will normally not change, and new items added to a list are added to the end of the list.

It is possible to add, remove and change items in a list after it has created.

Since all items in a list have index numbers it is possible to have multiple items with the same value.

Example:

myList = ["Joe", "Biden", "Joe"]
print(myList)




Much like strings the len() function can be used to determine the nmber of items in a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe", "Biden", "Joe", "Biden"]
print(len(myList))




A list can contain contain items of multiple data types both alone and mixed together.

Example:

myList = [12, 13, 14, 15]
myList2 = ["Joe", 23, "Biden", True]
print(myList, myList2)



If you use the function type() the list will be classified as an object with the data type of list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe", "Biden"]
print(type(myList)) #Prints, <class 'list'>
