Dictionaries are used to store data in key:value pairs, 

Dictionaries are ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates. They also use curly brackets.

Example:

myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red",
}
print(myDict) #Prints, {'Brand': 'Renault', 'Model': 'Reliable', 'Colour': 'Red'}



Dictionaries are ordered, this means that the order of the items will not change and that there is a defined order to the items.



Dictionaries are also changeable, this means that items in a Dictionary can be changed and that items can be added or removed.



Dictionaries cannot have duplicate values for the key segment of the key:value pairs.

Example:

myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red",
    "Colour": "Blue"
}

print(myDict) #Prints, {'Brand': 'Renault', 'Model': 'Reliable', 'Colour': 'Blue'} ,the duplicate key is removed











The dict() constructor can be used to create dictionaries.

Example:

myDict = dict( Continent = "Europe", Country = "United Kingdom", County = "Manchester")

print(myDict)
