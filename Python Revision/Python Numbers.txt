There are three numeric types in Python: int, float, complex

Example:

x = 5     #int
y = 9.55  #float
z = 1j    #complex


Of course the type() function can be used to verify any variable types.



Integers (int) is a whole number, positive or negative, without any decimal places, that can be of any length (unlimited)

Example:

x = 5
y = 5343535443
z = -3545



Floating point number (float), is a number that is either positive or negative with more than one decimal place, float values can also have an e or E, in order to represent a power of ten.

Example:

x = 9.5
y = 5.3e5
z = -5.45



Complex numbers are written with a j in order to represent the imaginary portions.

Example:

x = 3+5j
y = 3j
z = -4j



It is possible to convert between the three numeric data types by using casting, it is impossible to convert a complex variable.

Example:

x = 1
y = 1.2
z = 8j

a = float(x)
b = complex(y)
c = int(y)

print(a) #prints, 1
print(b) #prints, (1.2+0j)
print(c) #prints, 1.2

print(type(a)) #float
print(type(b)) #complex
print(type(c)) #int



Python does not have a random() function instead it has a pre-built module that can do it instead.

Example:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 50)
