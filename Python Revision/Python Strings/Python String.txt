Strings can be surrounded by either double or single quotes, you can also display a string literal using the print() function.

Example:

print("Hello!")
print('Hello!')



You can assign a string like any other data to a variable.

Example:

a - "Hello!"
print(a)



You can assign a multi-line string to a variable by using triple double qoutes or single quotes at both the beginning and end of the string. Also the line breaks are at the same points as in the code when printed

Example:

a = """I believe personally that 
this is one of the worst trade 
deals that america has ever made"""

print(a)




Strings in Python are arrays that represent unicode characters, so each element of a string can be accessed the same as an array.

Example:

a = "Hello!"
print(a[0]) #Prints, H




Since strings are arrays it is possible to loop through the string using a for loop

Example:

for x in "Autism"
    print(x)




The length of the string can be obtained by using the function len()

Example:

a = "Hello!"
print(len(a)) #Prints, 6




It is possible to check if a specific phrase or character is present within a string by using the in keyword.

Example:

a = "Impressive, very nice!"
print("very" in a)            #Prints, True





The keyword in can be used along with if.

Example:

a = "Impresive, very nice!"
if "very" in a:
    print("Yes there is very in this string")




Along with the in keyword there is also the not in keyword.

a = "Impressive, very nice!"
print( "very" not in a)      #Prints, False




This can also be used along with if.

a = "Impressive, very nice!"
if "Biden" not in a:
    print("There is no Biden in this string")
