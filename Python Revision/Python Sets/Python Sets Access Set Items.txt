As sets are unidexed it is not possible to refer to the items by index numbers instead the in keyword must be used, either in a for loop or to check if a specific value is present in the set.

Example:

mySet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in mySet:
    print(x)




mySet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print("banana" in mySet)



mySet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

if "apple" in mySet:
    print("apple")
else:
    print("no apple")
