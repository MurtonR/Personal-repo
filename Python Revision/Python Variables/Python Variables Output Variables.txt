The print() function is commonly used to output variables.

Example:

x = 5

print(x)


The print() function can also be used in order to output multiple variables in one line.

Example:

x = 5
y = "Hello!"
z = 9.64

print(x, y, z)


The + character can also be used to output multiple variables at once using the print() function, there is a space at the end of each variable value in order for it to print as three seperate words, also you cannot add string and integer variables.

Example:

x = "Welcome "
y = "Hello! "
z = "Joe"

print(x + y + z)


When used for two variables that are numbers the + becomes a mathematical operator (5 + 10 = 15).

Example:

x = 5
y = 10

print(x + y)


The best way to print multiple variables in the print() function is to the comma character, as this works for all variable types.

Example:

x = 5
y ="Hello!"

print(x, y) #This results in an output of, 5 Hello!
