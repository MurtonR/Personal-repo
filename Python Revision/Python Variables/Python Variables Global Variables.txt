Variables that are created outside of a variable are considered global variables and can be used by anyone both inside and outside of variables

Example:

x = 5

def MyFunc():
    print("Im not", x)


MyFunc()



If you create a variable with the same name as an existing variable inside of a function it is only useable inside that function and doesn't effect the global variable at all, a variable created inside a function is considered local.

Example:

x = 5

def MyFunc():
    x = 9
    print("Im not",x) #prints, Im not 9

MyFunc()

print("Im not",x) #prints, Im not 5



It is possible to create a variable inside a function that is global and not local by using the global keyword.

Example:

def MyFunc():
    global x
    x = 9

MyFunc()

print(x)  #Prints, 9 , even though the variable was created within a function



If you want to change a variable inside of a function the global keyword is required.

Example:

x = 5

def MyFunc():
    global x
    x = 9

MyFunc()

print(x) #prints, 9 ,the value of global variable x was changed within a function by using the global keyword
