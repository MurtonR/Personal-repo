A variable name can be short or long however there are rules when naming a variable:

-A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
-A variable name cannot start with a number
-A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
-Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
-A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Example:

myNum = 5
my5Num = 5
myNUM = 5
MYNUM = 5
_MyNum_ = 5
my_Num = 5


Here are some illegal variable names

Example:

3myNum = 5
my-Num = 5
my Num = 5


Many variable names will be multiple words here are some techniques in order (Camel Case), (Pascal Case), (Snake Case)

Example:

variableNameHere = 5


VariableNameHere = 5


variable_name_here = 5
