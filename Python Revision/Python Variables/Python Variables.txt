There is no need to declare a variable in python, they are simply created when you assign a value to them.

Example:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"


The variable type can be changed at any time, even after it has a value assigned to it.

Example:

x = 5
x = "Hello, World!"
print(x)


The type of a variable can be manually set, this is called casting, however the values assigned must be valid.

Example:

x = str(5)
y = int(5)
z = float(5.10)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


The type of a variable can be printed by using the type() function

Example:

x = str(5)
y = int(5)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))


String variables can be declared using either double or single quotes

x = "Joe"
y = 'Joe'

print(x)
print(y)


Variables are also case-sensitive

Example:

a = "Joe"
A = 'Joe'

print(a)
print(A)
