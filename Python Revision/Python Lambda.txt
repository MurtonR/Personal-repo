A lambda function is a small anonymous function, it can have any number of arguments but only one expression.


lambda arguments : expression

The expression is excuted and the result is returned.

Example:

x = lambda a: a + 12
print(x(5)) #Prints, 17


Multiple arguments can be used in a lambda function.

Example:

x = lambda a,b: a + 12 - b
print(x(3, 5)) #Prints, 10

x = lambda a,b,c: a + b + c
print(x(3,5,1))#Prints, 9


Lambda functions are often used as an anonymous function inside of other functions, say you have a function definition that has one argument and needs to be multiplied by an unknown number.

Example:


def my_function(n):
    return lambda a: n, a

my_double = my_function(2)

my_double(10) #Prints, 20
