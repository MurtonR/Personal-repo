# Personal-Projects-Repo



I was unable to link my Uni github so I've created a new account with most of the work I've done-

This is a collection of the work I've done and resources I've created for myself over the last of Uni.

I could not recover all of my work, the robotic arm for example is stuck with an early prototype of the code which I will get round to fixing eventually.

I've now added most of the work from the second year of Uni, this includes a research paper, poster and my work on our face tracking robot.
