Linear voltage regulator: 

-Converts higher input voltage to a specific output voltage.

-Wired to Ground, Input power and Output power to be used.

-May need a resistor 

Pros:

-Allows a stable and almost noise-less constant voltage

-Can be adjustable

Cons:

-Less efficient and release a relatively large amount of heat
