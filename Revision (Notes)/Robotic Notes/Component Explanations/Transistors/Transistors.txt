Transistors

-Also only a minimal amount of energy is lost as heat.
-Only adjusts current flow not voltage specifically.


NPN Transistor:

-Wired Base to Positive voltage (digital pin).
-Collector connects to Motor (load).
-Emitter connects to ground.

Used in digital circuits and high-speed switching


PNP Transistor:

-Wired Base to Lower voltage (digital pin).
-Emitter connects to power source.
-Collector connects to Motor (load).

Used in low-power applications and analog circuits


Applications:

-Can be used as a switch by setting the digital pin (HIGH, LOW).

-Can be used to power LED's or relays as the transistor amplifies current.

-A small current at the base controls the larger current between the collector and emitter.

-Can be used to amplify voltage.

-Can be used to shift voltage levels, for example one direction 3V controls 5V or the other way around.
