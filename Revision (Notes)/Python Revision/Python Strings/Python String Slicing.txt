You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax, state the start and end elements seperated by a colon. The end point is not included, position 4 in this case.

Example:

a = "Hello!"
print(a[1:4])




If no start element is stated then it will start from the beginning of the string. The end point is not included in what is printed.

Example:

a = "Hello!"
print(a[:4])





If no end position is stated then it will go until the final position.

Example:

a = "Hello!"
print(a[1:])




It is possible to slice a string from the end to beginning (opposite of normal slicing), this is called negative indexing. The first number in the square becomes the end point and is not included, in this case W.

Example:

a = "Hello World!"
print(a[-5:-2])    #Prints, orl
