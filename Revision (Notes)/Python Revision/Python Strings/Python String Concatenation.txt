It is possible to combine two seperate strings using the + operator, this is concatenation.

Example:

a = "Joe,"
b = "Biden"
c = a + b
print(c) #Prints, Joe,Biden




You can us " " in order to have a space between the two strings once combined

Example:

a = "Joe,"
b = "Biden"
c = a + " " + b
print(c) #Prints, Joe, Biden
