It is not possible to combine strings and numbers using the + operator

Example:

age = 25
txt = "I am" + age + "years old"
print(txt)




Instead to combine strings and numbers the format() method is used, the format() method takes the arguments, formats them and places them in the spot the {} placeholders were.

Example:

age = 25
txt = "I am {} years old"
print(txt.format(age))




You can use this method to combine an unlimited number of variables as there is no limit to the amount of placeholder {}

Example:

age = 25
name = "Joe"
numOfFriends = 12
txt = "I am {} years old, my name is {} and I have {} friends"
print(txt.format(age, name, numOfFriends))




`Using index numbers you can assign each argument to a place holder.

Example:

age = 25
name ="Joe"
numOfFriends = 12
txt = "I am {1} years old, my name is {2} and I have {0} friends"
print(txt.format(numOfFriends, age, name))
