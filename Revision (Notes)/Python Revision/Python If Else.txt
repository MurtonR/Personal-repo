This is an example of when the if keyword would be used.

Example:

a = 12
b = 21
if b > a:
    print("b is a larger number than a")              




The elif keyword is used "if the previous conditions are false then try this".

Example:

a = 12
b =12
if b > a:
    print("b is larger than a")
elif b == a:
    print("b is equal to a ")





The else keyword is used when none of the conditions are true.

Example:

a = 12
b = 11
if b > a:
    print( "b is larger than a")
elif b == a:
    print("b is equal to a")
else:
    print("b is less than a")
                                                                        


myTuple = ("Joe", "Biden", "Nice")
if "Joe" in myTuple:
    print("Joe is present")
else:
    print("Joe is not present")



mySet = {"Joe", "Biden", "Nice"}
while len(mySet) > 0:
    print(mySet)
    mySet.pop()
else:
    print("There are no more items in mySet")    






If both if and else only have one line to exexute it is possible put it all on one line.

Example:

a = 2
b = 3
print("a is bigger than b") if a > b else print("a is not bigger than b")          




The and keyword is a logical operator and is used to combine statements.

Example:  

a = 100
b = 200
c = 300

if c > b and b > a:
    print("c is the largest, then b and finally a is the smallest number")         






The or keyword is a logical operator and is used to combine conditional statements.

Example:

a = 600
b = 400
c = 100
if a > b or a > c:
    print("a is larger than atleast one other variable")






The not keyword is a logical operator and is used to reverse a condition.

Example:

a = 12
b = 13
if not a > b:
    print("a is not larger than b")
else:
    print("a is larger than b")
                                                       





You can have an if statement inside an if statement, this is called a nested if statement.

myTxt = "Joe Biden"

if "J" in myTxt:
    print("J is in myTxt")
    if "B" in myTxt:
        print("and so is B")
    else:
        print("J and B are not present in myTxt")       



x = 52

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
    if x > 50:       
        print("and 50")
    else:           
        print("x is less than 11")              





An if statement must have content, the pass statement can be used in order for it to not result in an error.

Example:

a = 23
b = 200

if b > a:
    pass
