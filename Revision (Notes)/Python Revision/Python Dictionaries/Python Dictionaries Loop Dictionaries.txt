You can loop through a dictionary by using the for keyword, this returns the keys however there are methods to return the values as well.

Example:

myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red"

} 

for x in myDict:
    print(x) #Prints, Brand, Model, Colour





In order to print the values either use the value() method or refer to the dictionary when using the print() function.

Example:


myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red"

} 

for x in myDict:
    print(myDict[x]) #Prints, Renault, Reliable, Red





myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red"

} 

for x in myDict.values():
    print(x)  #Prints, Renault, Reliable, Red







You can use the keys() method in order to only print the keys and then the items() method will print both the keys and values.

Example:

myDict = {
    "Brand": "Renault",
    "Model": "Reliable",
    "Colour": "Red"
}

for x in myDict.keys():
    print(x) #Prints, Brand, Model, Colour

for x in myDict.items():
    print(x) #('Brand', 'Renault') ('Model', 'Reliable') ('Colour', 'Red')
