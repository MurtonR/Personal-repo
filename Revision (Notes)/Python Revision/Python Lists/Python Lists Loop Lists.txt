Using the for and in keywords it is possible to loop through a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
for x in myList:
    print(x)




Using the range() and len() methods it is possible to loop through the list's items by referring to the index numbers.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
for i in range(len(myList)):
    print(myList[i])




By using the while keyword it is also possible to loop through a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
i = 0
while i < len(myList):
    print(myList[i])
    print(i)
    print() 
    i = i + 1




Using loop comprehension it is possible to create a short for loop that will loop through all the items in a list.

Example{

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Name!"]
[print(x) for x in myList]
