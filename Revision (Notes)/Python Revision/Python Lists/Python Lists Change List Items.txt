By referring to the index number it is possible to change the value of an item in a list.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!"]
myList[0] = "Trump"
print(myList[0])




It is also possible to change a range of items at once by referring to the index numbers and then stating the list of new items.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList[0:2] = ["Donald", "Trump"]   #Doesn't count [2] as the last index number in a range is not included
print(myList)





If you insert more or less items than the range includes the new items will be added where specified and the rest of the items will change accordingly, this also increases the length of the list, the items within the range originally are always removed even when the new list of items is less than the range.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList[0:1] = ["Donald", "Trump"] #Prints, ["Donald", "Trump", "Biden", "Nice!"] , 4 items when originally the list was 3
print(myList)




It is possible to replace multiple items with a single item:

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList[0:2] = ["Trump"] #If this is not in list form it will seperate each character as an item, "T" "R" "U" "M" "P"
print(myList) #Prints, ['Trump', 'Nice!'] , the list goes from 3 items to 2




It is also possible to insert a item at a specified index number by using the insert() method, the index number is where you want it's place to be once added so [0] would be the first item.

Example:

myList = ["Joe!", "Biden", "Nice!"]
myList.insert(0, "President")
print(myList)
