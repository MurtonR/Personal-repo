It is not possible to copy a list by simple doing thisList = myList as myList will only be a referrence to thisList and as such will be changed when thisList is changed.

Instead the copy() method should be used.

Example:

myList = ["Winner", "Happy", "Hero"]

newList = myList.copy()

print(newList)




It is possible to make a copy by using the built-in method list()/

Example:

myList = ["Winner", "Happy", "Hero"]

newList = list(myList)

print(newList)
