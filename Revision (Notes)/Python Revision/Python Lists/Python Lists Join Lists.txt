It is possible to join/concatenate lists by using one of three methods, using the + operator, using append() method or the extend() method.

Example:

myList = ["Winner", "Happy"]
myOtherList = ["Good", "Positive"]

jointList = myList + myOtherList

print(jointList)



Example:

myList = ["Winner", "Happy"]
myOtherList = ["Good", "Positive"]

for x in myOtherList:
    myList.append(x)

print(myList)




Example:

myList = ["Winner", "Happy"]
myOtherList = ["Good", "Positive"]

myList.extend(myOtherList)

print(myList)
