In order to use arrays in python, a library such as NumPy library needs to be imported.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in one variable:

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

print(Fruits) 


	
You can refer to an element in an array by using square brackets.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

print(Fruits[0]) #Prints, Apple



You can also change the value of an element in an array by referring to the index number.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

Fruits[1] = "Pear"

print(Fruits) #Prints, ['Apple', 'Pear', 'Cherry']



You can find out the number of items in an erray by using the len() method, the length of an array is always one more than the highest index number.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

print(len(Fruits)) #Prints, 3




You can loop through all the items in an array by using the 'for' 'in' keywords.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

for x in Fruits:
    print(x) #Prints, Apple
		      Banana
		      Cherry




You can use the append() method to add additional items to the array.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

Fruits.append("Pear")

print(Fruits) #Prints, ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Pear']




You can use the pop() method to remove the item/element related to a specific index number.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

Fruits.pop(0)

print(Fruits) #Prints, ['Banana', 'Cherry']




You can use the remove() method to remove a specific item/element from an array, this only removes the first occurence of the item.

Example:

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

Fruits.remove("Banana")

print(Fruits) #Prints, ['Apple', 'Cherry']




Here are all the methods that can be used with arrays:

append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()		Removes all the elements from the list
copy()		Returns a copy of the list
count()		Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()		Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()		Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()		Sorts the list
