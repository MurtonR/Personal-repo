It is possible to assign multiple variables values in the same line of code

Example:

x, y, z = 5, "Hello!", 9.5

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


It is also possible to assign the same values to multiple variables in the same line of code

Example:

x = y = z = "Hello!"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


You can also extract the values in a list to variables and then print them, this is called unpacking

Example:

presidents = ["Obama", "Joe", "Donald"]
x, y, z = presidents
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
