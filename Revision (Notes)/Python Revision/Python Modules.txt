Modules:

A module is a file that includes functions that you want to include in your code. A module can have any name.



To create a module save your code in a file with the '.py' extension.

Example:

def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)
    



In order use the module we need to use the import statement.

Example:

import mymodule

mymodule.greeting("Joe")




Not only can modules contain function, they can also contain variables of varying types, such as; dictionaries, objects, arrays etc.

Example:

import mymodule as mx

c = mx.greeting("Joe")

print(c)




There are several built-in modules in python such as 'platform'.

Example:
	

import platform

x = platform.system()
print(x)




The dir() function can be used to list all of the function and variable names in a module.

Example:

import platform 

x = dir(platform)
print(x)




You can use the 'from' keyword to import parts from a module, first we need to create the model and then use the import statement. When using the from keyword there is no need to refer to the module name, so its 'car' not 'mymodule.car'

Example:

def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)


car = {
   "Brand": "Renault",
   "Model": "Cleo",
   "Colour": "Red",
}

print(car["Brand"])

from mymodule import car

print(car{"Brand"])
