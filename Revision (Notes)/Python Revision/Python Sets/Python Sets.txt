Sets are unordered, unchangeable, unindexed and do not allow duplicate items.

Example:

mySet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}





As sets are unordered, the items will appear in a different order each time it is used and cannot be referrenced by index or key.




Sets are also unchangeable, which means once created the items in a set cannot be changed, however items can still be removed and added.




Sets do not allow duplicate items.

Example:

mySet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(mySet) #Prints, {'cherry', 'banana', 'apple'} , each item can only appear once, duplicates are removed






In sets the values of 1 and True are considered to be the same and as such cannot appear in the same set, False and 0 are also considered the same value.

Example:

mySet = {1, 2, 0, True, False}

print(mySet) #Prints, {0, 1, 2} , removes True and False as it considers them the same as 1 and 0 respectively




It is possible to make a set by using the set() constructor.

Example:

myList = ["Joe", "Joe", "Biden", "Nice"]

myList = set(myList)

print(myList) #Prints, {"Nice", "Joe", "Biden"} , removes the duplicates and is unordered so the order is random.




myTxt = "Apple"

myTxt = set(myTxt)

print(myTxt) #Prints, {'p', 'e', 'A', 'l'} , random order and removes one of the p as it is a duplicate value
