The "const" keyword can be used to make the value of a variable unchangeable and read-only (this declares the variable as constant)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
  const int myNum = 15;
  myNum = 10;            -This code when run results in an error as there is an attempt to change the value of the constant variable "myNum"
  cout << myNum;         -If run without the line above the code works and outputs 15
  return 0;
}


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int minutesPerHour = 60;  -This is an example of multiple variables being declared as constants as their values do not change.
  const double PI = 3.14;         -"double" or "float" can be used the only difference is that "float" has less decimal places
  cout << minutesPerHour << "\n";
  cout << PI;
  return 0;
}

You should always declare variables if they're unlikely to change.
