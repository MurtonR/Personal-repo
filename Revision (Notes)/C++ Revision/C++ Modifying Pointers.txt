Like any other variable it is possible to change the value of a pointer variable, remember it also changes the value of the variable that it points to aswell

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string food = "Pizza";  // Variable declaration
  string* ptr = &food;    // Pointer declaration

cout << food << "\n";

cout << ptr << "\n";

*ptr = "Mac and Cheese";

cout << ptr << "\n";
 
cout << food << "\n";
return 0;
}
