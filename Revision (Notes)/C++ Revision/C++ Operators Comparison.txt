Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0) and boolean values.

Operator	Name	                         Example
==	        Equal to	                 x == y	
!=	        Not equal	                 x != y	
>	        Greater than	                 x > y	
<	        Less than	                 x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	 x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	         x <= y
