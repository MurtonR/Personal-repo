string txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";

-This results in an error as the double quote character is misunderstood
 
Escape character	Result	        Description
\'	                '	        Single quote
\"	                "               Double quote
\\                 	\               Backslash


The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."; -For a "string" the backslash escape character is used
  cout << txt;
  return 0;
}
