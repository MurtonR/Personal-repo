The "char" data type is used to store a single character this character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
  char myGrade = 'B'; -Declared variable "myGrade" with a value of 'B'
  cout << myGrade;
  return 0;
}


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
  char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67; -Declaring the variables "a", "b", and "c" with the values '65', '66' and '67'
  cout << a;                   -When using a "char" type variable you can declare the value of a variable with ASCII
  cout << b;                   -'65' is "A", '66' is "B" and '67' is "C"
  cout << c;
  return 0;
}
