-Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
-Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
-Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
-Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int time = 22;
  if (time < 10) {
    cout << "Good morning.";  -If time is less than 10 output "Good morning"
  } else if (time < 20) {     -If time is less than 20 output "Good day"
    cout << "Good day.";
  } else {                    -If time is anything else output "Good evening"
    cout << "Good evening.";
  }
  return 0;
}


There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

(variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;)


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int time = 20;
  string result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";  -"Good day" is output when the result is "true" (1)
  cout << result;                                               -The "?" is important 
  return 0;                                                     -is "false" (0) then "Good evening" is output
}
