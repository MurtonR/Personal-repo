To check is an character is present in a string you can use std::set<std::string> ____  and then .count()
This returns 1 if the character is present and 1 if not

std::set<std::string> checking {"a","b","b","c"};

if(checking.count("b")){
   return 1;
}
else{
   return 0;
}


If you use multiset it will return the number of times that element appears instead

std::multiset<std::string> checking {"a","b","b","c"};

return checking.count("b");
