You can use the pointer to get the value of the variable, by using the * operator (the dereference operator):

Example

int main() {
  string food = "Pizza";  // Variable declaration
  string* ptr = &food;    // Pointer declaration

  // Reference: Output the memory address of food with the pointer
  cout << ptr << "\n";

  // Dereference: Output the value of food with the pointer
  cout << *ptr << "\n";
  return 0;
}

The * is used to undo the effects of & by turning the memory address back into the value that is represents, in this case it turns the memory address for the variable food back into the value "Pizza"


Note that the * sign can be confusing here, as it does four different things in our code:

When used in declaration (string* ptr), it creates a pointer variable.
When not used in declaration, it act as a dereference operator.
It also is used in order to do multiplication.
It also can be used to code multi-line comments
