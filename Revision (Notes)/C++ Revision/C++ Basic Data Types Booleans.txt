A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false.

When the value is returned, true = 1 and false = 0.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  bool isCodingFun = true;      -So the value of "isCodingFun" is now "True" or "1"
  bool isFishTasty = false;     -So the value of "isFishTasty" is now "False" or "0"
  cout << isCodingFun << "\n";  -Outputs "isCodingFun" as "1" and drops a line
  cout << isFishTasty;          -Outputs "isFishTasty" as "0" one line below "isCodingFun"
  return 0;
}
