Ros2 Services:

A service communicates info from node to node on a call and response basis, one call calls for the data, then the service requests the data from another node, before passing it on to the original caller.

Similar to topics but the "subscriber" and "publisher" nodes are now called "sevice client" for the caller and "service server" for the responder. 


You can get a list of all services using:

-ros2 service list


You can get the type that a service is by using:

-ros2 service type <service_name>
-ros2 service type /clear


You can use '-t' to get the type of all services at the same time:

-ros2 service list -t


You can use 'info' in order to get the type and the number of both service client and servers 

(this does not work in this version of ros2)

-ros2 service info <service_name>


You can use the 'find' command to get a list of all services with a certain type:

-ros2 service find <service_type>
-ros2 service find rcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters


You can use 'interface show' to get the expected data structure for a service:

-ros2 interface show <service_type>
-ros2 interface show turtlesim/srv/Kill


You can use 'call' to call a service for a response from a node:

-ros2 service call <service_name> <service_type> <message>
-ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 2.0, y: 2.0, theta: 20}"
