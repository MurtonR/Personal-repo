Ros2 Nodes:

Creating a python node:

-pixi run ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --destination-directory src --node-name my_node my_package 


Here is what each section means and why it is present, this is common between most node setups:

-Creates a node using "ament_python" in the destination "src" with the node name "my_name" and a package called "my_package"

-A node is a piece of software within a robotics system

-A node publishes data and other nodes subscribe, this ensures a one way form of communication that allows the "movement" node for example to understand which direction to turn from the "sensor" node.



Dependency to add C++ Nodes to Ros2 that use CMake:

-pixi add ros-humble-ament-cmake-auto compilers pkg-config cmake ninja


Creates a C++ node called "my_code_node" and with a package (code) called "my_cpp_package":

-pixi run ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --destination-directory src --node-name my_cpp_node my_cpp_package



"ros2 run" launches an executable:

-ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
-ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
