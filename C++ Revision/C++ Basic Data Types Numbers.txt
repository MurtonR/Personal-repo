Use "int" when you need to store a whole number without decimals, like "35" or "1000", and "float" or "double" when you need a floating point number (with decimals), like "9.99" or "3.14515".


The precision of "float" is only six or seven decimal digits, while "double" variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

"double" can be used for bigger calculations and is safer to use because of this.



A "e" or "E" can be used to represent a power of "10"


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
  float f1 = 35e3;     -Represents 35 x 10^3
  double d1 = 12E4;    -Represents 12 x 10^4
  cout << f1 << "\n";  -Outputs "f1" and then drops a line with "\n"
  cout << d1;          -Outputs "d1" one line below "f1"
  return 0;
}
