#include <iostream>  -Header title
using namespace std; -Can use names for objects and functions from the standard library

int main() {                 -Function that means any code within the curly brackets will be executed
  cout << "Hello World!";    -"Cout" is an object used with "<<" insertion opereator to output/print text
  return 0;                  -This ends the function
}                            - The curly brackets fully ends the funtion "int main()" 




#include <iostream>  -Same as before however the "using namespace std;" is replaced by "std::" in the function

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
