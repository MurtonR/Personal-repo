A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.


C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.

To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():


void myFunction() {         -Void means that the function does not have a return value and myFunction is the name
  // code to be executed
}




Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.

To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;

In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!"; -This is what the function outputs once run, however it is not run immediately
}

int main() {
  myFunction();                    -It is only when the function is run here does it output "I just got executed!"
  return 0;
}


A function can be run multiple times.

void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!\n";
}

int main() {
  myFunction();
  myFunction();
  myFunction();
  return 0;
}



A C++ function consist of two parts:

Declaration: the return type, the name of the function, and parameters (if any)
Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed)
 

If a user defined function is declared after the main() function then an error will occur

For example:

int main() {
  myFunction();
  return 0;
}

void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}

// Error



However it is possible to seperate the decleration and definition in order to better optimise the code

Many C++ programs have the decleration of a function above main() and then the definition underneath in order to make the code more organised and easier to read

// Function declaration
void myFunction();                       -This declares the function but does not define it yet, resulting in no errors

// The main method
int main() {
  myFunction();  // call the function
  return 0;
}

// Function definition
void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}
