The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for string (and cout)

This is for programs that do not use the standard namespace library


#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string greeting = "Hello";
  std::cout << greeting;
  return 0;
}
