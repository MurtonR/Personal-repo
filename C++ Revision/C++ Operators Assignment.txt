Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables, such as "=" (int x = 10;)

The assignment operator "+=" is used to add a value to a variable

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  x += 5;      -Adds "5" to "x" which has a value of "10" 
  cout << x;   -Outputs "5" + "x" which equals "15"
  return 0; 
}




Operator    Example	     Same As	
"="	    x = 5            x = 5	
"+="	    x += 3	     x = x + 3	
"-="	    x -= 3	     x = x - 3	
"*="	    x *= 3           x = x * 3	
"/="	    x /= 3	     x = x / 3	
"%="	    x %= 3	     x = x % 3	-Modulus operation that gives the remainder left when divided
"&="	    x &= 3	     x = x & 3	-AND operation using the binary equivilant of each number
"|="	    x |= 3	     x = x | 3	-OR operation using the binary equivilant of each number
"^="	    x ^= 3	     x = x ^ 3	-XOR operation using the binary equivilant of each number
">>="	    x >>= 3	     x = x >> 3	-Shift it right by three bits 
"<<="	    x <<= 3	     x = x << 3 -Shift it left by three bits (101 becomes 101000)
