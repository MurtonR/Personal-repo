All C++ Variables must have unique names called "identifiers"

Can be of varying length and characters "myNum" or "67" could be identifiers

The general rules for naming variables are:

-Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
-Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
-Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
-Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
-Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Good name
  int minutesPerHour = 60;
  
  // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is  -A variable name should be descriptive to make the code easier to read
  int m = 60;    
  
  cout << minutesPerHour << "\n";    -Outputs the value of "minutesPerhour" and the the escape sequence "\n" shifts the code down one line
  cout << m;                         -Outputs the value of "m" one line below "minutesPerhour
  return 0;
}
