With function overloading, multiple functions can have the same name with different parameters:

int myFunction(int x)
float myFunction(float x)
double myFunction(double x, double y)




Instead of making two seperate variables that do the same with different data types it is better to overload one 


int plusFunc(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

double plusFunc(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

int main() {
  int myNum1 = plusFunc(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusFunc(4.3, 6.26);
  cout << "Int: " << myNum1 << "\n";
  cout << "Double: " << myNum2;
  return 0;
}

Note: Multiple functions can have the same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different.
