"cin" is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator ">>".
"cin" is used to get user input 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x;                                                       -Declaring "int" variable "x"
  cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter  
  cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard                -Whatever the user input is the value of x is set to that
  cout << "Your number is: " << x;                             -Outputs the user input via "x"
  return 0;
}

cout is pronounced "see-out". Used for output, and uses the insertion operator (<<)

cin is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (>>)


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x, y;                  -declaring variables
  int sum;                   -defining "sum"
  cout << "Type a number: ";
  cin >> x;
  cout << "Type another number: ";  -Using cin and cout together can make a basic calculator 
  cin >> y;                         -Defining the values of the variable "y" and "x" so that they can be added together
  sum = x + y;                        
  cout << "Sum is: " << sum;
  return 0;
}
