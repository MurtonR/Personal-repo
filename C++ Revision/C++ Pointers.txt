A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:

int main() {
  string food = "Pizza";  // A string variable
  string* ptr = &food;  // A pointer variable that stores the address of food

  // Output the value of food
  cout << food << "\n";

  // Output the memory address of food
  cout << &food << "\n";

  // Output the memory address of food with the pointer
  cout << ptr << "\n";
  return 0;
}

There are multiple ways to declare a pointer variable however there is one that is preferred

string* mystring; // Preferred
string *mystring;
string * mystring;
