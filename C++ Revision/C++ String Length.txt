To get the length of a string, use the length() function, the size() function can be used instead but has the same effect.


int main() {
  string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.size(); -"txt" is the variable and it is with ".size()"
  return 0;
}
