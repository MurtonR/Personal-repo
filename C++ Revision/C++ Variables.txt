Variables are containers for storing data values, there are many different types of variables such as:
-"int" stores integers (whole numbers)
-"double" stores decimals (floating point)
-"char" stores single characters (these values are surrounded by single quote characters)
-"string" stores text (these values are surrounded by double quote characters)
-"bool" stores values with two states (True or False, 1 or 0)

Declaring (Creating) Variables:

type variableName = value; -An example of "type" is "int" or "string"
                           -variableName can be anything as long as it isnt already defined
	                   -value is the data that the variable is storing


int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum; -This is an example of a variable called myNum which is an "int" variable with a value of 15 


int myNum;
myNum = 15;      -A variable can be declared "int myNum" without assigning a value til a later line "myNum = 15;"
cout << myNum;


int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10   -A variable that is assigned a new value later on, overwrites the last value
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10


int main() {
  int myNum = 20;   // Now myNum is 20
  cout << myNum << endl;  // myNum is printed as 20   -This is more obvious when run and uses a escape sequence "endl" 
  myNum = 30;       // Now myNum is 30
  cout << myNum;  // myNum is printed as 30
}


These are example of different variables:

-int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
-double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
-char myLetter = 'D';         // Character -Note single quote characters
-string myText = "Hello";     // String (text) -Note double quote characters
-bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)


int main() {
  int myAge = 19;  -"cout" along with "<<" at beginning and end can be used to output a variable
  cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old.";  // This outputs "I am 19 years old
  return 0;
}
  

int x = 5;   -Variables can be added by using the "+" character however "sum =" must be used beforehand
int y = 6;
int sum = x + y;
cout << sum;
