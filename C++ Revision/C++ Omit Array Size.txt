In C++ there is no need to declare the size of an array "myNum[5]" as the compiler is smart enough to determine the size based on the number of inserted values "myNum[]"

-However it is considered good practise



-You can not input any array elements and simply declare them later

int main() {
  int cars[5];
  cars[0] = 4;
  cars[1] = 5;
  cars[2] = 6;
  cars[3] = 7;
  cars[4] = 8;
  cars[5] = 9;
  for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << cars[i] << "\n";
  }
  return 0;
}

-However is very important to have actually declared the values of each element when the code is run
