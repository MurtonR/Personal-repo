Behaviour-Based systems primary inspiration for creation came from several challenges with other control architectures.

-Reactive systems are too inflexible, incapable of representation adaptation or learning.

-Deliberate systems are too slow and cumbersome.

-Hybrid systems require complex means of interaction between components that is difficult to get right.

-Biology seems to have evolved complexity from simple and consistent compomnents that function together.






Behaviour-based control uses "behaviours" as modules for control, Behaviour based controllers are implemented as a collection of behaviours.
Behaviours also called 'behaviour-achieving modules' have some rules on what is and what is a behaviour:

-Behaviours achieve and/or maintain particular goals, a homing behaviout achieves the goal of getting the robot to a "home" location whereas a wall-following behaviour maintains the goal of following a wall.

-Behaviours take time and are not instantaneous, for example following a wall or travelling "home" both take an extended period of time to achieve/maintain those goals.

-Behaviours can take inputs from sensors and other behaviours, they also can send outputs to effectors and other behaviours. This means we can create a network of behaviours that "talk" to eachother

-Behaviours are more complex than actions, for example a reactive system might use simple actions such as "turn right", "stop" or "move forward 5m", Behaviour-Based control uses time-extended commands such as "find object", "follow target" or hide from the light".



Behaviours can be designed at varying levels of detail or description, this is called their level of abstraction, beacuse to abstract is to remove details and make things less specific. Because of this behaviours are quite flexible in terms of the amount of time and computation that a behaviour will require, however this flexibility isn't only from the varying levels of abstraction but also from the organisation of behaviours. Here are some principles for good behaviour based control design:

-Behaviours are usually executed in parallel in order to enable the controller to respond immediately when needed.

-Networks of behaviours are used to store state and to construct world models/representations. When assembled into distributed representations, behaviours can be used to store history and to look ahead into the future.

-Behaviours are designed so they can operate on compatible time-scales. This means that it is not good behaviour based control system design to have very slow and some very fast time-scale behaviours in the same system. This should be avoided as it makes the system hybrid and it is challenging to interface different time-scales.



Behaviour based systems are not limited like reactive systems (reactive systems have no representation) while still not using a hybrid system structure (not middle layer).
Behaviour based systems have the following key properties:

-The ability to react in real-time.

-The ability to use representations to generate efficient (not only reactive) behaviour.

-The ability to use a uniform structure and representation throughout the system (with no intermediate layers like a hybrid system).



Most behaviour based control systems are designed so the effects of the behaviours interact in the environment rather than internally through the system in order to thake advantage of 'interaction dynamics'. In this context those dynamics refer to patterns and history of interaction and change. The idea that rules or behaviours can interact to produce more complex outputs is called emergent behaviour.

In general behaviour based controllers are networks of internal behaviours that interact (send messages to each other) in order to produce the desired external, observable, manifested robot behaviour.


Behaviours are activated in response to internal/external conditions, sensory inputs and internal state or messages from other behaviours. Dynamics of interaction arise both within the system itself (from the interaction among the behaviours) and within the environment (from the interaction of the behaviours and the external world).
