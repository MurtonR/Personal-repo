Robot: A robot is an autonomous system that exists in the physical world that can sense it's surroundings and act upon it to achieve some goals.


Autonomous: An autonomous robot is one that acts upon it's own decisions and is not controlled by a human.

Machines can be operated by humans, however these are not true robots are are instead considered to be 'teleoperated'.

Robots have to be able to sense their environment, so sensors are a requirement for any robot. It is impossible to act on the environment in order to achieve a goal if you can't sense the environment.

The important next logical step from sensing it's environment is acting on it, something that is required in order for a machine to be considered a true robot.

If a robot acts on the data from its's sensor then it needs to be acting towards some goal, an objective or end condition.


Robotics is the study of robots, specifically their autonomous and purposeful sensing and acting in the physical world.
